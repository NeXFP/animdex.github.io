            <h3>Sports turn strangers into friends</h3>
            <p class="styledFont"> From a show starting off as something not many people have seen before, this show does an amazing job of developing each character into almost a main character.
                <br>
                At some point the show contains drama that fuels the drive of each individual person to do their best. I think this anime captures how people who actually played sports,
                <br>
                may feel when they've had these moments. This show was a masterpiece in my book, not only in animation or OSTs, but character building and story. I don't think I'll ever run into a sports anime 
                <br>
                that will ever make me feel this emotional towards the success of characters ever again. </p>
