            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p class="styledFont"> Chika Takami, a self-proclaimed normal girl, has never been involved in any clubs and lacked any notable talents. However, after a visit to 
                <br>
                Tokyo, she discovers a stage where even an ordinary girl like her could shine—the world of school idols. Inspired by the former superstar
                <br>
                school idol group μ's, Chika is determined to start her own school idol club in her seaside hometown at Uranohoshi Girl's High School. But 
                <br>
                even before gathering any students to join the group, the aspiring school idol finds her greatest obstacle to be student council president Dia 
                <br>
                Kurosawa who stands firmly against the creation of the club.
                <br><br>
                Just when it seems there is no hope, Chika meets Riko Sakurauchi, a transfer student from Otonokizaka High School, home of μ's. 
                <br>
                Somewhat shy but a talented piano player, Chika believes her to be a promising recruit, though convincing her to join is easier said than 
                <br>
                done. In spite of that, Chika chooses to charge forward and overcome the obstacles keeping her from forming a school idol group that 
                <br>
                shines as bright as the nine that came before her.</p>
