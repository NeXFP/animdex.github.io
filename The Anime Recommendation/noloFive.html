            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p class="styledFont"> Kazuya Kinoshita is a 20-year-old college student who has a wonderful girlfriend: the bright and sunny Mami Nanami. But suddenly, he 
                <br>
                doesn't. Without warning, Mami breaks up with him, leaving him utterly heartbroken and lonely. Seeking to soothe the pain, he hires a 
                <br>
                rental girlfriend through an online app. His partner is Chizuru Mizuhara, who through her unparalleled beauty and cute demeanor, manages 
                <br>
                to gain Kazuya's affection.
                <br><br>
                But after reading similar experiences other customers had had with Chizuru, Kazuya believes her warm smile and caring personality were 
                <br>
                all just an act to toy with his heart, and he rates her poorly. Aggravated, Chizuru lambastes him for his shameless hypocrisy, revealing her 
                <br>
                true pert and hot-tempered self. This one-sided exchange is cut short, however, when Kazuya finds out that his grandmother has collapsed.
                <br><br>
                They dash toward the hospital and find Kazuya's grandmother already in good condition. Baffled by Chizuru's presence, she asks who this 
                <br>
                girl might be. On impulse, Kazuya promptly declares that they are lovers, forcing Chizuru to play the part. But with Kazuya still hung up on 
                <br>
                his previous relationship with Mami, how long can this difficult client and reluctant rental girlfriend keep up their act?</p>
