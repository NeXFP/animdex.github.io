            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p class="styledFont"> Asta and Yuno were abandoned at the same church on the same day. Raised together as children, they came to know of the "Wizard King"—a
                <br>
                 title given to the strongest mage in the kingdom—and promised that they would compete against each other for the position of the next Wizard
                <br> 
                King. However, as they grew up, the stark difference between them became evident. While Yuno is able to wield magic with amazing power and
                <br>
                control, Asta cannot use magic at all and desperately tries to awaken his powers by training physically.
                <br><br>
                When they reach the age of 15, Yuno is bestowed a spectacular Grimoire with a four-leaf clover, while Asta receives nothing. However, soon
                <br>
                after, Yuno is attacked by a person named Lebuty, whose main purpose is to obtain Yuno's Grimoire. Asta tries to fight Lebuty, but he is
                <br>
                outmatched. Though without hope and on the brink of defeat, he finds the strength to continue when he hears Yuno's voice. Unleashing his
                <br>
                inner emotions in a rage, Asta receives a five-leaf clover Grimoire, a "Black Clover" giving him enough power to defeat Lebuty. A few days later,
                <br> 
                the two friends head out into the world, both seeking the same goal—to become the Wizard King!</p>
